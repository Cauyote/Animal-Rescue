    <p>King Crabs have a life span of 30 years of age where they live it in a solitary, peaceful enviroment.
    When a baby King Crab is hatched, it automatically looks like what it will become when it grows up. Their spiny backs and appendages give them excellent defense against their hunters. </p>

  <p>The pistol shrimps have the capability to fire a cavitation bubble that generates acoustic pressures up to 80 kPa.
  The shrimp is actually near the top of the "Loudest animal in the world" contest due to the claw alone, competing against the sperm whale and the baluga whale. Be careful when housing such a small creature because their shots can shatter small glass jars. </p>

    <p class="Lobster"> Also known as the bulldozer lobster, Sergey and other slipper lobsters have the ability to "doze" over sand to crate a flat surface.
    This is used to make a home or a useful hunting position. Slipper lobsters can get up to eight inches for males and seven inches for females.
  Slipper Lobsters aren't exactly slippers nor lobsters, being more related to furry and spiny lobsters then true lobsters.</p>
